'''
A JobScheduler is the final component of scheduling and that serves as the
interface between the simulation server and the web server.

It creates an instance of a JobGenerator class, and priotises the incoming
jobs as defined by the Scheduler implementation whenever a request for a job
is made.

* Attention has to be made to ensure that the jobs are scheduled in a timely
and sensical manner such that it is able to process the jobs quicker than they
are generated.

Methods:
  .start() - Starts the JobGenerator component
  .stop()  - Stops the JobGenerator component
  .getJob(data) - Fetches the next scheduled job. `data` will contain the
                  simulation data, including number of idle drones (so a buffer
                  of emergency drones can be reserved. A schema of can be found
                  in the schema folder.
