'''
The Job class resembles the data structure of a job that is to be sent to the
simulation server. More attributes can be added in the future if it describes
a more realistic model for the simulation.

uid: Should be a unique ID that will be used to identify and display each job
     on a dashboard. Could be incrementing integers or Hash IDs.

creation_time: The time at which the job was created; this allows job
               generators to easily determine a sense of "real-time" if needed

content: The contents of the job, i.e. the item(s) that it is carrying.

cost_function: An instance of CostFunction that allows the job holder to
               determine immediate and projected reward values

pick_up: The coordinates where the item is to be picked up from (lat, lon)

destination: The coordinates where the item is to be delivered to (lat, lon)

The JobFactory class is a convenient interface that can be used to generate a
series of Jobs.

A JobFactory should be initialised with:

origin - A (lat, lon) coordinate that corresponds to a drone dispatch depot
range - An area described by a radius of <range> meters where
        the jobs (both pick-up and destination) will be limited to.

The potential contents, rewards and penalty of each job can be configured in a
`config.ini` file within the same directory as this file.

The only function that will need to be called by anyone using this class is
`generateJob()`. This function returns a Job object, whose instantaneous reward
can be determined by `Job['cost_function'].getReward(0)`.

The creation_time of the job is set to the UNIX timestamp (time.time()) at the
time when `generateJob()` was called.
